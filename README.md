## About
This is a tool to create easy to find, named by the game, symbolic links to proton/wine prefixes for Steam games.
It will search through your home directory to find location of steam installation. If there are multiple, it will ask you which one (or all of them) you want to use

Only requirement is an up to date Python 3. No virtual environment is neccesary.

Recently added install/uninstall scripts.

Installing globally requires sudo privelages, locally does not.

### To Install
`chmod +x *.sh`
`./install-global.sh` OR `./install-local.sh`

### To Uninstall
`./uninstall-global.sh` OR `./uninstall-local.sh` (Depending on which one you used to install)
